1st Approach -> Easier to develop but maybe expensive
	-Move NPC according to grid
	-When he needs to transition between scenes, disable everything except controller and schedule (to keep track of current destination)
	-Continue moving the npc as if he was on the active scene, but moving towards the position he needs to be in his current (inactive) scene
	-When the player enters the scene the NPC is in, enable other components

2nd Approach -> Harder to develop but maybe less expensive
	-Move NPC according to grid
	-When he needs to transition between scenes, disable everything except controller and schedule (to keep track of current destination)
	-Keep track of 'time elapsed' since he transitioned between scenes
	-When the player enters the scene the NPC is in, calculate, based on time elapsed and the NPC's speed, where it should spawn
